**AI Generated Art:**

All of the artwork is generated using a neural network. That means each painting you see is completely unique and one of a kind! Find one you like? Hold on tight and don’t lose it! 

**Objective:**

Curate 6 pieces of artwork from an infinite museum. Choose paintings of the right size and synergy. Will tonight’s art show be a success?

**Controls:**

WASD – Movement

Left Click – Grab/Place

T - Teleport

**Hardware**:

We are working on trying to optimize the game for lower-end hardware. Right now the neural network will slow down the game at some points if your hardware isn't fast enough.
